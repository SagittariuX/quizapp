#Intentions 
This is a quick project for me to learn about React and front-end development.
This application is designed to be lite.

#Tech Choices
React - Learning experience, fast and dynamic
Firebase - easy and fast to use/setup (especially with React hook)

#Needed improvements
Currently the quiz take the last 3 questions from the database, need to find a good way to randomly gather questions from firebase.
Results page could be more informative, UI/UX can be more intuitive.

Tech Stack: HTML/CSS, React, Firebase
AdditionalL Material-ui, react-router, final-form, firebase-hooks
